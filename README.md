## Hi there 👋

Hi, I'm **Rohit Praveen Nair** — an AI & Data Science student who builds models that understand humans, optimize paths, and occasionally test my patience. My work focuses on solving real problems while keeping things interpretable, efficient, and sustainable (aka: *making AI useful, not mysterious*).

### 🧠 About Me
- 🎓 **B.Tech CSE (Artificial Intelligence)** @ Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Bangalore
- 📘 **B.Sc Data Science** @ IIT Madras (BS Degree) 
- 🚀 Hackathons, research papers, and club leadership — I collect them like Pokémon badges
- 💡 Currently into AI that tracks eyes, speech, clouds, viruses, and anything else I can responsibly analyze
- ⏱ Fixing my time management one **time-block** at a time

### 🚧 Featured Projects

#### 🔬 **Transparent Epitope Discovery for Monkeypox**
I built a **CNN–BiLSTM + Attention** model that predicts epitopes, checks toxicity, and asks an LLM to explain itself like it’s writing a biology textbook footnote.  
(*Motto*: “If the model found it, it better explain it.”)

#### 👁 **Eye-Gaze Tracking for Personalized Brand Advertising**
A webcam-based gaze tracker that calibrates in 6 points, captures eye coords, detects AOIs, and generates heatmaps to prove exactly where your attention was… sorry 😌   
(*Totally not spying, just data science*)

#### 🌍 **Water Stress-Aware Multi-Region Cloud Scheduler**
A multi-region scheduler that scores regions using **water stress, carbon, and temperature**, then uses **softmax + EMA smoothing** to route workloads like a climate-aware air traffic controller.  
(*Cloud computing, but make it eco-friendly*)

#### 🗣 **Self-Supervised DL Framework for Dysarthria Detection**
Compared **DNN vs CNN-BiLSTM** on HuBERT embeddings + acoustic features, validated with 5 folds, optimized for clinical screening, and trained to detect speech impairments.  
(*ML for speech, DL for contex)
